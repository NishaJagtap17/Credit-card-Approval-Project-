Introduction:
---
A bank's credit card department is one of the top adopters of data science. A top focus for the bank has always been acquiring new credit card customers. Giving out credit cards without doing proper research or evaluating applicants' creditworthiness is quite risky. The credit card department has been using a data-driven system for credit assessment called Credit Scoring for many years, and the model is known as an application scorecard. A credit card application's cutoff value is determined using the application scorecard, which also aids in estimating the applicant's level of risk. This decision is made based on strategic priority at a given time.
Customers must fill out a form, either physically or online, to apply for a credit card. The application data is used to evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness. The decision is made using the application data in addition to the Credit Bureau Score, such as the FICO Score in the US or the CIBIL Score in India, and other internal information on the applicants. Additionally, the banks are rapidly taking a lot of outside data into account to enhance the caliber of credit judgements.

Goal: The project aims to evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness using the application data, utilizing data analysis and machine learning techniques.
How: We use Python and MySQL for data analysis, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning to evaluate creditworthiness.
Why: Our project is crucial because giving out credit cards without doing proper research or evaluating applicants' creditworthiness is quite risky.

Q1 . Why is your proposal important in todayâ€™s world? How predicting a good client is worthy for a bank? 

ANS :

Predicting a good client is crucial for a bank to mitigate financial risks and optimize profitability. Factors such as credit history, income stability, and debt levels are analyzed to assess a client's creditworthiness. Accurate predictions enhance loan approval accuracy and reduce the likelihood of defaults, ensuring a healthier financial portfolio.

Q2. How is it going to impact the banking sector? 

ANS:

Implementing a machine learning project for client creditworthiness in banking enhances risk assessment accuracy, streamlines loan approvals and reduces defaults. This fosters more responsible lending, improves financial stability, and optimizes resource allocation, leading to a more efficient and profitable banking sector with lower financial risks..

Q3.If any, what is the gap in the knowledge or how your proposed method can be helpful if required in future for any bank in India..

ANS:

A bad quality of data or missing data can prove to be a problem for such models but if it works well Implementing this machine learning approach in Indian banks would enhance credit risk evaluation, ensuring more reliable lending decisions. It could reduce non-performing assets, optimize resource allocation and foster financial stability, contributing to a robust banking system that aligns with evolving economic dynamics in India..
